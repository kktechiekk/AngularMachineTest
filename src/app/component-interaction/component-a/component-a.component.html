Component B value in Component A is : {{showBValue}}

<br>

<app-component-b [componentAValue] = "componentAValue" ></app-component-b>

<!-- 

Given this information, please answer following questions:
 1) What options do we have to establish such communication?
Answer : Multiple options which we have are : 
   i) @input() decorator : sharing data from parent to child
   ii) @ViewChild() decorator : sharing data from child to parent
   iii) creating service and storing value in service variable and accessing it from there only.
   iv) using Behaviour Subject Observable also we can share data between components.
   v) @output() event emitter : sharing data from child to parent

 2) For each option describe what are the pros and cons of this solution?
 Answer : 
 Pros : i) No need to apply the change detection manually in angular while using @Input, @ViewChild,@output().
        ii) Helps in making the component resuable by passing dynamic parameters to components.
Cons : 
       i) event emitters might be costly in terms of optimization perspective if used more .
       ii) might lead to Expression changed dynamic console errors if not used properly.
       iii) can be used only if there is parent-child relationship between the components. If no relationship, we cannot use it.

 3) For each option describe what are the cases the solution fits best?
Answer : i) for parent to child relationship between component, @Input() is the best fit case.
         ii) for child to parent relationship, @ViewChild & @output() are the best fit case.
         iii) for generic resuable functions and variables, services are the best fit case
         iv) to get the latest subscibe value between component, behaviour subject observable is the best fit
